When the Achieans had been in Troy for 10 years, Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size. Menelaus, Ulixes, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, and Neoptolemus were gathered in the horse. And they wrote on the horse "the Greeks give this gift to Minerva", and they moved their camps to Tenedo. When the Trojans saw the it, Priamus led the horse to the temple of Minerva. Although Cassandra said that the horse held enemies, faith was not given to her, and they positiioned the horse in front of the temp. The Achieans exited and killed the guard of the entrance, and they aquired Troy.
