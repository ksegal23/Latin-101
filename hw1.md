1. A regular Latin verb has 4 principle parts (unless it doesn't have an active form, in which case it has 3). 
2. The 3rd principle part is used to form finite verbs in perfect tense and active voice. First person singular is used to do so. 
3. The 3rd principle part of facio, feci, is identical to the 3rd principle part of interficio, interfeci, with the addiiton of the prefix inter-. In the first and second principle parts, the a in facio is exchanged for an i in interficio. In the fourth principle part, the a in factus is exchanged for an e in interfectus. Other than the vowel exhanges, the principle parts of facio are identical to interficio with the addition of the prefix. 
4. Venire belongs to the fourth conguation. It's principle parts are fairly regular, with the stem only changing for the fourth principle part (vent- instead of ven-). 
Audire belongs to the fourth conguation. It's first two principle parts are regular, but it's 3rd and 4th have slightly different stems. 
5. When comparing the verbs capio and facio, their principle parts change in the same way. The stem of the first principle part ends in i, while the stem of the second principle part ends with the consonant before the i. In the third principle part we see the largest change, where the vowel in the stem changes from a to e (still ending on the consonant like in the 2nd principle). Lastly, the stem of the fourth principle part has a t added to the end of it.
